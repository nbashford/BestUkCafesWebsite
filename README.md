REQUIRES - "all_cafes_csv.csv" - cafe data generated by the project:
    CafeDataScraping,
    from: https://github.com/nbashford/CafeDataScraping

Note - 
the FIRST user to Sign Up is set as the administrator - changes the addition of Add Cafe data.
If user is Administrator - then Add Cafe page adds the new cafe data to the main Cafes Database.

TODO: 
1. Still requires additional NavBar functionality
2. add comments to Cafes
3. Possibly images for each Cafe
